    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Monsterchase is my very first game. It is a 2D platformer with basic jumping and shooting functionalities.
    </p>
    <h2>Development Process</h2>
    <p>I followed along the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB1F9G0JXOo&t=23707s">tutorial</a> by Free code Camp, and added many more extra features.</p>
    <h3>Is it copied from tutorial?
    </h3>
    <p>My version of monsterchase has the following add ons on top of what is shown in tutorial:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Shooting FeaturE: </strong>You can shoot your enemies with left click
          </li>
          <li><strong>2. Coins and Levels: </strong>It has levels that can be cleared by collecting all the coins present in a particular level. </li>
       </ul>
       <p>As you progress to higher levels, monsters come more frequently and they are more agile. The number of coins you need to collect also increases.</p>
